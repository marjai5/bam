        generators, redundant routers, and so on. Depending on the cloud provider you choose, they can manage all of
        this for a monthly fee. Reducing expenses is essential in any business model and every cloud-based platform

        need for individual users or teams to maintain their own backups onsite or offsite. This lowers the risk of data
        loss should any one backup fail or be destroyed by a disaster. Cloud providers can restore the data from another
        copy maintained in their cloud storage, which is continuously updated with every piece of data added.

        Teams can take advantage of cloud security technologies such as data encryption and two-factor authentication
        for greater privacy than they'd have when relying on their own equipment or servers at home or in the office.
        Oracle uses a security-first cloud architecture with automated protection built in.

        Higher performance and availability
        By using cloud computing resources together simultaneously, you reap greater performance gains than by having
        your own dedicated server hardware. Cloud computing increases input/output operations per second (IOPS).

        Cloud services also offer high availability with no downtime because they’re distributed across multiple cloud
        facilities. Cloud providers are responsible for updating cloud systems and fixing bugs and security issues in
        cloud software, which is transparent to end users.
